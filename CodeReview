I can see only one new file: FINAL CODE. This still seems to be the code of a Tumblr page, which is not allowed for this course.
See my remarks from last november below. You need to build your own website and not use a template or service like Tumblr.

Dear Roya,

I see in the PSD file that you're working in Tumblr. This isn't allowed for this
course. You are expected to write and understand the HTML/CSS without the use of
a template.

We also haven't seen you in the Skillslab class for a while, so we aren't able to
get an insight in your progress.

kind regards,

Joël Plas
