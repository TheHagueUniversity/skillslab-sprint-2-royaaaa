		<h3>About me</h3>
    <!-- REVIEW: this is a <h1> -->
		 <p>My name is <strong> Roya,</strong> and this website works both as my portfolio and my 'escape' place where I can look for inspiration whenever I lose the motivation. I come from a small town in Uzbekistan. I live in The Hague with my little sister and little brother and my mom. When I was around the age of 8 we moved to the Netherlands. I went to <em>Hofstad Lyceum,</em> VWO Bilingual. After the first 3 years, my Bilingual education changed to IB. I received my International Baccalaureate diploma in 2015 and got my VWO diploma in 2016. I study Communication and Multimedia Design User Experience on <em>The Hague University </em> of Applied Science. </p>
		 <p> My interest varies from psychology, human interest and behaviour to <strong>design and creativity. </strong>I love to explore Photoshop and making graphic designs, explore my creativity. I find human interaction and behaviour very interesting  </p>
		 <p> In my free time I like to read and shop (obviously). But I also like taking long walks on the beach or whenever and having a chill day in. I like working with Photoshop the most and I've been using Photoshop CS6 for my graphic designs for quite a while now. </p>

    What is this? Could this be an aside as in additional information about you?
    By your HTML I can't give any meaning to it
