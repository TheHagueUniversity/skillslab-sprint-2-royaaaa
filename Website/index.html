		<h3>Designing with your mind </h3> 

		<p>Art is establishing your ideas. Art is coping with things. Art is letting your imaginations go free.  Art is creativity. <strong>Creativity </strong> is exploring and pushing yourself to the max. This all is crucial for one thing: designing. Even as a kid I loved exploring art and creativity. When I was 12 years old I was introduced to Photoshop. Now, at 21 I still love using PS and I still love learning more amazing things I can do with it. My creativity has helped me a lot whether it was to feel better more secure about myself or take my mind off of things. </p> <p>My name is <a href="about.html">Roya</a>, and this website works both as my portfolio and my 'escape' place where I can look for inspiration whenever I lose the motivation. Feel free to look through the site.</p>
